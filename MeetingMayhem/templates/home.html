Scenario: 
</h1>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:Lucida Console, Courier New, monospace;">
You are an agent embedded in hostile territory.
One of your fellow agents has been caught, and your mission is to aid them in their escape.
You are attempting to arrange a meeting with other allied agents to exchange information critical to this mission.
However, your only means of communication with your team has been compromised by a hostile Adversary.
Can you successfully arrange a safe meeting with your team, or will the Adversary trick you into meeting somewhere unsafe?
</p></br></br>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">
Directions: 
</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<ul>
<li>Send messages to your allies to arrange a meeting time and place.</li>
<li>Beware of the Adversary attempting to cause confusion or trick you.</li>
<li>When available, use crypto primitives to your advantage.</li>
<li>Encryption: Enc(<username>.pub) - ex: Enc(user1.pub)</li>
<li>Signing: Sign(<username>.priv) - ex: Sign(user1.priv)</li>
<li>When you are ready to choose your meeting time and place, click the "Ready to Vote" button.</li>
</ul>
